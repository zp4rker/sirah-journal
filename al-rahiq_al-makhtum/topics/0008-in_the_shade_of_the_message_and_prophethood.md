**Title:** In the Shade of the Message and Prophethood

**Pages:** 86 -> 93

---

I'm not sure if meditation is the best word, but whatever you want to call it: al-nabī ﷺ did a lit of it and the author says it was a vital stage for preparing him for al-nubuwwah.

> When he was forty, the peak of one's life - and they say it is the age when Prophets were always ordered to disclose their Message - signs of his Prophethood...

Hmm, interesting. I wonder what the source of that is; the disclosing of the message ordered at the age of forty because it sure is interesting.

> Included among these signs were that the stones in Makkah would greet him with Salam.

Subḥānallāh! I did not realise this miracle occurred prior to his ﷺ nubuwwah.

> The period of Prophethood was 23 years, so this six-month period full of true visions constituted to an integral part of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.

Ooooh, very interesting! I did not realise that some have derived from that hadith of 46 parts to Prophethood to mean time-based parts. 23 years / 46 = 6 months and Ramaḍān is exactly six months before **and** after rabī' al-'awwal. Absolutely astounding... subḥānallāh!

Even more interesting stuff! Man am I enjoying this page, according to this book the first day that al-nabī ﷺ received revelation was on yawm al-ithnayn (Monday) - the same day that he ﷺ entered as well as left this world.

> with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ exactly 40 lunar years, 6 months and 12 days of age, i.e., 39 Gregorian years, 3 months and 22 days.

Subḥānallāh, the common perception or at least my own perception of the past upon hearing that al-nabī ﷺ was 40 years old when prophethood began was that he was 40 solar years old but how wrong I was. I guess all the different ages and lengths of time would have been based on the lunar cycle however due to our huge reliance upon the solar calender a lot of us in the Western world would mistake it for lengths of time in the solar cycle.
