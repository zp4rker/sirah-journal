**Title:** In the Shade of the Message and Prophethood

**Pages:** 86 -> 93

---

I'm not sure if meditation is the best word, but whatever you want to call it: al-nabī ﷺ did a lit of it and the author says it was a vital stage for preparing him for al-nubuwwah.

> When he was forty, the peak of one's life - and they say it is the age when Prophets were always ordered to disclose their Message - signs of his Prophethood...

Hmm, interesting. I wonder what the source of that is; the disclosing of the message ordered at the age of forty because it sure is interesting.

> Included among these signs were that the stones in Makkah would greet him with Salam.

Subḥānallāh! I did not realise this miracle occurred prior to his ﷺ nubuwwah.

> The period of Prophethood was 23 years, so this six-month period full of true visions constituted to an integral part of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.

Ooooh, very interesting! I did not realise that some have derived from that hadith of 46 parts to Prophethood to mean time-based parts. 23 years / 46 = 6 months and Ramaḍān is exactly six months before **and** after rabī' al-'awwal. Absolutely astounding... subḥānallāh!

Even more interesting stuff! Man am I enjoying this page, according to this book the first day that al-nabī ﷺ received revelation was on yawm al-ithnayn (Monday) - the same day that he ﷺ entered as well as left this world.

> with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ exactly 40 lunar years, 6 months and 12 days of age, i.e., 39 Gregorian years, 3 months and 22 days.

Subḥānallāh, the common perception or at least my own perception of the past upon hearing that al-nabī ﷺ was 40 years old when prophethood began was that he was 40 solar years old but how wrong I was. I guess all the different ages and lengths of time would have been based on the lunar cycle however due to our huge reliance upon the solar calender a lot of us in the Western world would mistake it for lengths of time in the solar cycle.

Wait, so Waraqah ibn Nawfal used to write scripture even though he was blind? I can't even fathom how he managed that, and does that mean he had memorised all of it?

I'm curious what Waraqah's final destination will be, since he said he would have supported al-nabī ﷺ if he were to live to that day.

According to the author al-nabī ﷺ became suicidal multiple times during the period when there was a pause of revelation and that each time he ﷺ tried Jibrīl 'alayhi al-salām would calm him down and remind him that he is a messenger of Allah. I wonder if these narrations are authentic or not because personally they seem kind of contradictory. I see no other reason for al-nabī ﷺ to be depressed except if he thought that he ﷺ was no longer worthy of being a messenger in the eyes of Allāh however according to the author, Jibrīl 'alayhi al-salām kept reminding him that he **was indeed** a messenger of Allāh and this happened multiple times??? I don't see how he al-nabī ﷺ kept trying this **especially** if this period only lasted for a few days.

> The Second: Wha the angel invisibly cast in the Prophet's mind and heart, without being seen.

Hmm, interesting... I'm not sure if it means here that Jibrīl 'alayhi al-salām was invisible to other than al-nabī ﷺ or if he was invisible to al-nabī ﷺ too. I would assume the former because he ﷺ did say that he saw Jibrīl 'alayhi al-salām.
