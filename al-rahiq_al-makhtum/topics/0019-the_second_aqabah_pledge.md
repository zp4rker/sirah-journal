**Title:** The Second 'Aqabah Pledge

**Pages:** 189 -> 196

---

Bismillāh. It's been a while but in shā allāh I'll make this a regular habit again. I will try to catch up moving backwards from where I am currently, it appears I have only missed about 9 topics so it shouldn't be too unreasonable.

> over seventy converts from Madinah came along with the polytheist people to perform the rituals of pilgrimage in Makkah.

I wonder if this was meant in general or if it meant that polytheists accompanied the Muslims (from Madīnah) for the pilgrimage. Reading on further, it seems to suggest the latter which is quite interesting that the polytheists were willing to go on pilgrimage *with* the Muslims.

We learn here that even before Islām al-'Abbās raḍiallāhu 'anh would like to accompany and take care of his nephew, kind of similar to Abū Ṭālib except for the fact that al-'Abbās raḍiallāhu 'anh actually accepted Islām eventually.

Subḥānallāh, they were guaranteed Jannah for fulfilling the articles of the pledge, what a blessed incident to be a part of.

> Prophet ﷺ smiled and replied

Ya rabb, grant me the blessing of seeing your beloved nabi ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam smile.

I find it quite interesting and remarkable that some of the anṣār (to be) made sure to let the rest know that they better be all in or just back out now and yet all of them decided to take the pledge which speaks volumes about their imān and sincerity.

Oh, so Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr also participated in the pledge... I wonder if he was the only non-Anṣāri to do so and if so, what an honour! Also on that note, I wonder if he raḍiallāhu 'anh is considered a muhājir, anṣāri or neither.

Ya ghafūr, forgive me for being ignorant of so many whom you have attested to being pleased with.

Most of the names from the chosen 12, I simply do not know and I find it quite disappointing. The only ones I know are Sa'd ibn al-rābi', 'Abd Allāh ibn Rawāḥah, 'Ubādah ibn al-ṣāmit and Sa'd ibn 'Ubādah.

> "This is Azab (the jinn) of Al-'Aqabah. O enemy of Allâh! We are leaving you now."

Very very very interesting... jinn tried to cause harm to the da'wah like this.

Ooooh, so apparently the Anṣār had the manpower to take out the Quraysh that early on but with Allāh's wisdom then al-nabī's ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam wisdom that route was not taken.

Subḥānallāh, there was a wisdom for the polytheists accompanying the Muslims on this pilgrimage. EVEN 'Abd Allāh ibn Ubay ibn Salūl worked in their favour.

Wow... I didn't think any of the Anṣār would have been tortured by the Quraysh but Sa'd ibn 'Ubādah did. May Allāh raise his ranks for going through that.
