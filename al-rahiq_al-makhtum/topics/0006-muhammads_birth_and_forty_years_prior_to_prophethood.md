**Title:** Muhammad's Birth and Forty Years prior to Prophethood

**Pages:** 71 -> 83

---

This book takes the opinion that al-nabī ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī'ul Awwal which goes against what the Milād-celebrating Sūfis of today consider to be his day of birth. Personally, I take the difference of opinion in his date of birth and lack of clarity of when exactly it was to be a solid proof against the act of celebrating the milād.

> "When he was born, there was a light that issued out of pudendum and lit the palaces of Syria."

This is a *very* interesting alleged quote of the mother of al-nabī ﷺ, Āminah. Had to google what pudendum means, "a person's external genitals, especially a woman's." I guess it's referring to the breast then? Also, why on earth did she say the palaces of *Syria*? Perhaps she had been to Syria in her lifetime and thought they were beautiful? Allāh knows best.

Ooooh, this is interesting some *reported signs* that accompanied his ﷺ birth:
- The collapse of 14 balconies of the Kisra's palace (hmm, doesn't seem *that* significant however I find it quite interesting that the number is mentioned)
- The "sacred" fire of the Magians went out (I wonder how long it was alight for prior to it going out and also how they reacted to it going out)
- Some churches on Lake Sawa sinking down and/or collapsing (The closest city to Lake Sāwah is al-Samāwah which based on the Wikipedia article would have been home to Arabs, Yahūd and at some time Byzantines.)

Interesting, so Āminah suckled him ﷺ then Thuwaybah, the freed slave of Abu Lahab and then I'm guessing later on Ḥalīmah. Was it a common practice for a number of different women to suckle the same baby?

Oooooh, very interesting, Muḥammad ﷺ was almost not going to be picked by any of the foster mothers because of him being an orphan. I would have thought that people would have fought to have him due to his lineage.

It seems that al-nabī ﷺ would have spent more years in the care of Ḥalīmah as opposed to with his own mother, Āminah which is very very interesting but I guess Āminah couldn't have known that she wouldn't live long after the birth of Muḥammad ﷺ.

I really wonder what the other elders of Makkah would say when they saw 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib showing such high regard of al-nabī ﷺ since 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib was one of if not the most influential people in Makkah and the whole of Arabia at large.

> Abu Talib went to Al-Ka'bah with a young boy who was as beautiful as the sun, and a block cloud was over his head. Abu Talib and the boy stood by the wall of Al-Ka'bah and prayed for rain.

Interesting... I wonder if al-nabī ﷺ also prayed in this incident or if he just stood by the side of Abū Ṭālib or if he actually prayed as well and if he did pray, how did he pray?

Aaah, the famous incident of Baḥīrā al-Rāhib. Hmm, I did not know that some have said his name is Georges; I'll probably try to research about a Georges from Busra. Ooooh, according to some he was a Sabian or Mandaean which is veeery interesting. Actually I think the opinion that he was Nestorian makes more sense as that is closer to Christianity and he was described as a Christian. I was unable to find anything on him by the name of Georges so instead I am looking at the Wikipedia page on "Bahira." Okay, there doesn't seem to be much info on him and I personally think it's a Rabit-hole to go into it anyways.

> ...he worked as a shepherd for **Bani Sa'd** and in Makkah for a wage.

Woah! Is that the same Banī Sa'd of Ḥalīmah al-Sa'dīyah? If so, that is very interesting and I wonder if it was intentional.
