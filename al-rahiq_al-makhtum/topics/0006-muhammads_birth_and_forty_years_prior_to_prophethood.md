**Title:** Muhammad's Birth and Forty Years prior to Prophethood

**Pages:** 71 -> 83

This book takes the opinion that al-nabī ﷺ was born on the 9th of Rabī'ul Awwal which goes against what the Milād-celebrating Sūfis of today consider to be his day of birth. Personally, I take the difference of opinion in his date of birth and lack of clarity of when exactly it was to be a solid proof against the act of celebrating the milād.

> "When he was born, there was a light that issued out of pudendum and lit the palaces of Syria."

This is a *very* interesting alleged quote of the mother of al-nabī ﷺ, Āminah. Had to google what pudendum means, "a person's external genitals, especially a woman's." I guess it's referring to the breast then? Also, why on earth did she say the palaces of *Syria*? Perhaps she had been to Syria in her lifetime and thought they were beautiful? Allāh knows best.

Ooooh, this is interesting some *reported signs* that accompanied his ﷺ birth:
- The collapse of 14 balconies of the Kisra's palace (hmm, doesn't seem *that* significant however I find it quite interesting that the number is mentioned)
- The "sacred" fire of the Magians went out (I wonder how long it was alight for prior to it going out and also how they reacted to it going out)
- Some churches on Lake Sawa sinking down and/or collapsing (The closest city to Lake Sāwah is al-Samāwah which based on the Wikipedia article would have been home to Arabs, Yahūd and at some time Byzantines.)

Interesting, so Āminah suckled him ﷺ then Thuwaybah, the freed slave of Abu Lahab and then I'm guessing later on Ḥalīmah. Was it a common practice for a number of different women to suckle the same baby?
