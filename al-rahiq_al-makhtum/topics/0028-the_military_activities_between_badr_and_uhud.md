**Title:** The Military Activities between Badr and Uhud

**Pages:** 279 -> 291

Subḥānallāh, there were three distinct forces opposing the Muslims: the pagans of Makkah, the Jews of Madīnah and the bedouins of Arabia.

I thought I had already wrote this, but I can't seem to find it in my journal so I'll write it again in shā allāh. It's as if al-nabī (ṣ) and the Muslims were granted so many blessing around the time if the Battle of Badr. They were granted, the fasting of Ramaḍān, the victory at Badr, the celebration of 'Īd al-Fitr, some more military victories after Badr. It seemed like such a positive year for the Muslims, I can only imagine their morale was on a real high at that stage.

Subḥānallāh, I find it quite interesting and beautiful even that the one who stopped 'Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumaḥī was none other than 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (r) and the reason I find it remarkable is because of the parallels with how 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (r) set out to kill al-nabī (ṣ) however Allāh had planned that he would end up accepting Islām instead and the exact same happened with 'Umayr ibn Wahb (r).

The book doesn't really seem to give much details about Safwān's reaction once he had found out that 'Umayr (r) had accepted Islām like I mean he said he would look after his family and pay his debts... did Safwān think about harming 'Umayr's (r) family and/or revoke/cancel his paying off of 'Umayr's (r) debts?

So Shās ibn Qays sent a youth to sit among the Muslims and incite the enmity from the times of jāhiliyyah in the hearts of the Anṣār. I find this quite interesting, the Jew appears to have been accepted into the gathering and interact with them, was this something that happened often? Or was it that the Jew did not really join the group but rather just came and said his piece then left. This book doesn't really mention much about the interactions between the Muslims and Jews before they were expelled so I'm quite curious to how it was like.

Subḥānallāh, you look at how when the Muslim woman was oppressed by the Jews, one of the Muslim men and killed that Jewish blacksmith and yet we look at our society today where our women are exposing themselves on their own! and yet no one is doing anything... may allāh guide us back to the truth.
