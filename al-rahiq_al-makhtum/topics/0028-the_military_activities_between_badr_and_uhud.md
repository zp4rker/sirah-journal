**Title:** The Military Activities between Badr and Uhud

**Pages:** 279 -> 291

---

Subḥānallāh, there were three distinct forces opposing the Muslims: the pagans of Makkah, the Jews of Madīnah and the bedouins of Arabia.

I thought I had already wrote this, but I can't seem to find it in my journal so I'll write it again in shā allāh. It's as if al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam and the Muslims were granted so many blessing around the time if the Battle of Badr. They were granted, the fasting of Ramaḍān, the victory at Badr, the celebration of 'Īd al-Fitr, some more military victories after Badr. It seemed like such a positive year for the Muslims, I can only imagine their morale was on a real high at that stage.

Subḥānallāh, I find it quite interesting and beautiful even that the one who stopped 'Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumaḥī was none other than 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and the reason I find it remarkable is because of the parallels with how 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb set out to kill al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam however Allāh had planned that he would end up accepting Islām instead and the exact same happened with 'Umayr ibn Wahb raḍiallāhu 'anhumā.

The book doesn't really seem to give much details about Safwān's reaction once he had found out that 'Umayr (r) had accepted Islām like I mean he said he would look after his family and pay his debts... did Safwān think about harming 'Umayr's (r) family and/or revoke/cancel his paying off of 'Umayr's (r) debts?

So Shās ibn Qays sent a youth to sit among the Muslims and incite the enmity from the times of jāhiliyyah in the hearts of the Anṣār. I find this quite interesting, the Jew appears to have been accepted into the gathering and interact with them, was this something that happened often? Or was it that the Jew did not really join the group but rather just came and said his piece then left. This book doesn't really mention much about the interactions between the Muslims and Jews before they were expelled so I'm quite curious to how it was like.

Subḥānallāh, you look at how when the Muslim woman was oppressed by the Jews, one of the Muslim men and killed that Jewish blacksmith and yet we look at our society today where our women are exposing themselves on their own! and yet no one is doing anything... may allāh guide us back to the truth.

Subḥānallāh, after Badr it seems that a lot of tribes had the courage to attack the Muslims despite the Muslims absolutely destroying the Quraysh in the battle of Badr. A lot of them just ended up fleeing but still... subḥānallāh.

According to Yasir Qadhi, the killing of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf is something that the islamaphobes use to attack Islām but I have never once come across this attack either personally nor seen it online and honestly I don't see what's problematic with it at all. 

> He then rode to makkah where he started to activate the fire of war

Anyone who incited war in any society or civilisation would either be killed or jailed regardless of faith so I don't really see the problem.

> ...Abu Na'ilah, i.e., Salkan bin Salamah, Ka'b's foster brother, volunteered to do the job.

I find this very very interesting, Ka'b had foster brothers... now this could mean a few things. Ka'b was part 'Arab and part Jew so perhaps he(and or his parents) still underwent 'Arab cultures and traditions and thus the foster mother. It is a possibility that the Jews of Madīnah also took part in this culture of sending their children to a foster mother (usually with a bedouin), now whether it was the same as the 'Arabs as in sending the child with a bedouin or the Jews just had their own way, I'm not too sure; it doesn't really mention Abū Nāilah as a Jew so I'm more leaning towards the former.

Subḥānallāh, the Muslims were really giving the pagans of Quraysh trouble 😂. No wonder they so badly wanted revenge at Uḥud.

Alḥamdulillāh, that's my first time embedding an image into myt journal; looks like it works quite well so in shā allāh I will likely continue to use this feature.
