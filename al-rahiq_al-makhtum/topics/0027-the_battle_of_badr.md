Bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm

Hmm interesting, the book mentions that the caravan was relatively close to Madīnah; why didn't the Quraysh make it a habit to avoid Madīnah by a big margin? Did they not realise that the Muslims were likely to strike back at some stage?

Subḥānallah, the ratio of the army was 26% muhājirīn, 20% 'Aws and 54% Khazraj. I always thought that the muhājirīn would have been the majority but they were merely a quarter.

al-nabī ﷺ shared a camel with 'Alī and a ṣaḥābī named Marthad ibn Abī Marthad al-Ghanawī raḍiallāhu 'anhumā; this is my first time hearing of him, his father was also a ṣaḥābī and was selected as the flag bearer in one of the pre-Badr campaigns–also someone I had just heard of for the first time, may Allāh forgive me for my ignorance.

> cut off the nose and ears of the camel, turned its saddle upside down, tore off his own shirt from front and behind...

I- I'm assuming he did this to make it all the more dramatic but... I'm just lost for words. Why did he overdramaticise it?

> All the clans of Quraish gave their consent except Banu 'Adi

This is actually quite surprising, this is the tribe of 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭab raḍiallāhu 'anh. I wonder why they decided not to consent.

I did not know that Surāqah ibn Mālik was the chief of Banī Kinānah, that's quite interesting.

Subḥānallāh, the Quraysh set out with the intention of war whereas the Muslims set out simply to intercept a caravan and **not** to face an entire army.

That quote and reference to the Banī Isrāīl according to this book was said by al-Miqdād raḍiallāhu 'anh however I heard elsewhere that it was Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh raḍiallāhu 'anh who said it. I realise I've been saying things like that a lot, and although I've been hesitant to mention where I got that information from but I feel obliged to now mention it since admittedly I do believe that source to be unreliable–and that source is none other than Yasir Qadhi... Although I have my contentions, I will give him the benefit of the doubt since he certainly is more knowledgeable than me and has access to the Arabic sources unlike me. I should also add that the transmission of the information goes through my memory so it could actually be that my memory is misconstruing it and it is actually not from Yasir Qadhi.

I really wish I could get a hold of the details of the conversation al-nabī ﷺ had with those two boys considering they were just beaten by the soldiers (the Muslims) of that very man (al-nabī ﷺ) who was talking to them.

The incident with al-Ḥubāb ibn al-Mundhir about choosing where to camp, I find is very beautiful and quite enlightening how the ṣaḥāba knew from the very beginning that al-nabī ﷺ was merely a human and that the ultimate power belongs in the hands of Allāh.

According to the map on page 260, there were actually people living in the area of Badr; some bedouins, a village and even a castle. I'm unsure if this was later on (after the battle) or at/before the battle.

> The duel was followed by a few more duels but the Makkans suffered terrible defeats...

I did not know there were multiple duels, I thought there was only one and thought that was the custom but apparently not. Aaaand I accidentally read an extra page, I'll continue from here tomorrow in shā allāh.

> And you (Muḥammad ﷺ) threw not when you did throw but Allāh threw.

Subḥānallāh, what a remarkable āyah.

> These (the dates) are holding me back from Paradise.

I- the- the level of imān... I just...

What an interesting incident, with how Muḥammad ﷺ said to 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb raḍiallāhu 'anh "Is it fair that the face of the Messenger's uncle be struck with sword?"

Wait does that technically mean Umm al-Faḍl raḍiallāhu 'anhā dealt the wound to Abū Lahab which ended up killing him?

I really wonder what the emotions were like for al-nabī ﷺ after Badr; there was the victory from battle, but also the death of his daughter... I can't imagine it would have been easy.
