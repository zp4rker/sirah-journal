Bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm

Hmm interesting, the book mentions that the caravan was relatively close to Madīnah; why didn't the Quraysh make it a habit to avoid Madīnah by a big margin? Did they not realise that the Muslims were likely to strike back at some stage?

Subḥānallah, the ratio of the army was 26% muhājirīn, 20% 'Aws and 54% Khazraj. I always thought that the muhājirīn would have been the majority but they were merely a quarter.

al-nabī ﷺ shared a camel with 'Alī and a ṣaḥābī named Marthad ibn Abī Marthad al-Ghanawī raḍiallāhu 'anhumā; this is my first time hearing of him, his father was also a ṣaḥābī and was selected as the flag bearer in one of the pre-Badr campaigns–also someone I had just heard of for the first time, may Allāh forgive me for my ignorance.

> cut off the nose and ears of the camel, turned its saddle upside down, tore off his own shirt from front and behind...

I- I'm assuming he did this to make it all the more dramatic but... I'm just lost for words. Why did he overdramaticise it?

> All the clans of Quraish gave their consent except Banu 'Adi

This is actually quite surprising, this is the tribe of 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭab raḍiallāhu 'anh. I wonder why they decided not to consent.

I did not know that Surāqah ibn Mālik was the chief of Banī Kinānah, that's quite interesting.

Subḥānallāh, the Quraysh set out with the intention of war whereas the Muslims set out simply to intercept a caravan and **not** to face an entire army.

That quote and reference to the Banī Isrāīl according to this book was said by al-Miqdād raḍiallāhu 'anh however I heard elsewhere that it was Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh raḍiallāhu 'anh who said it. I realise I've been saying things like that a lot, and although I've been hesitant to mention where I got that information from but I feel obliged to now mention it since admittedly I do believe that source to be unreliable–and that source is none other than Yasir Qadhi... Although I have my contentions, I will give him the benefit of the doubt since he certainly is more knowledgeable than me and has access to the Arabic sources unlike me. I should also add that the transmission of the information goes through my memory so it could actually be that my memory is misconstruing it and it is actually not from Yasir Qadhi.

I really wish I could get a hold of the details of the conversation al-nabī ﷺ had with those two boys considering they were just beaten by the soldiers (the Muslims) of that very man (al-nabī ﷺ) who was talking to them.
