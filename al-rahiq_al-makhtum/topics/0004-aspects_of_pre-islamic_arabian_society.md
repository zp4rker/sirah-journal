It's quite astonishing how differently women are treated depending on which class they're in; if they're in the upper-class they're one of the most esteemed figures and if they're in the lower class, they are the bottom of the bottom, despised and even buried alive (as baby girls).

> ...and a seeress would tell whose child it was.

I googled "seeress" and it came up with:

> In Germanic religion and Germanic mythology, a seeress is a woman said to have the ability to foretell future occurrences.

I don't think that is what is being referred to here, I've heard that there were certain sciences back then which unfortunately to my knowledge no longer exist; one of them was being able to tell if people were related by looking at certain aspects of them, for example the feet like in the example with Usāmah ibn Zayd raḍiallāhu 'anhumā.

> Women always accompanied men in their wars. The winners would freely have sexual intercourse with such women, but disgrace would follow the children conceived in this way all their lives.

Does this mean their own women if they win and I assume it would be other than their wives? Or does it mean the winners who take these women as captives. Either way, it is a very strange practice.

> They could marry two sisters at the same time, or even the wives of their fathers if divorced or widowed.

Whaaaaaat? So, marrying the divorced wife of your son even if adopted was a taboo but not the marrying of your father's divorced wife...? What if she gave birth to your half-siblings... That's pretty messed up.

> ...and they would kill their children for fear of poverty and hardship.

Why did they have kids then? I know there were forms of or at least one form of contraception/birth control/whatever it's called at that time so did they not practice that or was it not effective enough or did they just not want to take away from their pleasure during intercourse? I just can't fathom someone killing their own child no matter what the reason except of course if they're literally insane.

> We should not think, however, that the act of killing infants was commonplace and widespread, simply because of the great need they had for sons to fight with them against their enemies.

Ah, my question was answered just had to keep reading. It's a little relieving that it wasn't widespread but still... it was commonly known at least.

Today, we don't really pay much heed to the sacred months since honestly there isn't much need to as we're not in a constant state of war and such however reflecting back on how it was implemented (likely at the time of Ibrāhīm 'alayhi al-salām) allowed for the Arabs to actually last and not just perish due to a constant state of fighting and wars.

We as Muslims today often have this negative stigma of the Arabs in the jāhiliyyah stage as being absolute monsters and having absolutely no good in them but if you actually look into most if not all sīrah works you'll find that they actually had quite a number of very good and favourable attributes.

> Gambling was also another practice of theirs closely associated with generosity since the proceeds would always go to charity.

This is actually news to me, I heard of the Arabs being hospitable but I wouldn't have guessed that they had the concept of charity and that "all their proceeds" from gambling would go towards such charities. The author appears to use this to explain the āyah where Allāh says there is some benefit in drinking and gambling but the sin outweighs the benefit.

The second virtue mentioned: keeping a covenant. Something which is very much lacked today, even among a lot of Muslims unfortunately. May Allāh guide us towards being truthful and protect us from lying.
