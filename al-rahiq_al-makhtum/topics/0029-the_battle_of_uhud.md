This is quite a large chapter but a fascinating and vivid one. I'm still behind in my journalling, but I can remember from my reading of this chapter that plenty came to mind.

I wonder if they forbade the ransoming of their own before or after some of them were actually ransomed, or was it the case that besides the prohibition people went ahead ransomed their familiy members anyways.

Subḥānallāh, that's a *huge* amount of wealth they spent on the war and there was probably even more wealth speant on it from elsewhere; perhaps this is how the Quraysh always had so many mounts in comparison to the Muslims, because they just so much wealth.

> three thousand camels

That gets me every time... that is an absolute fortune and absolutely dwarfs the amount of mounts the Muslims had.

Mannn, Hind bint 'Utbah raḍiallāhu 'anh sure was a wild one before accepting Islām... how much hatred and enmity must have overcome them to even possibly **think** of digging up the grave of anyone let alone the mother of al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam.

Subḥānallāh, al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam narrated and interpreted his dream in front of the ṣaḥāba to support his opinion of staying in Madīnah instead of going out and yet some who missed out on Badr insisted on going out to fight.

In the famous saying of al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam:

> It does not suit a Prophet that once he had put on armor, he should take it off, until Allâh has decided between him and the enemy.

I find it quite interesting that he said it in this instance, like I'm curious if they decided to stay in the city... would they have not worn armor? perhaps they wouldn't have worn at that stage specifically but instead later?

ibn Umm Maktūm raḍiallāhu 'anh appears to be someone who al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam appointed in charge of Madīnah in his absence quite a lot. Subḥānallāh, he was blind too...

In the Battle of Uḥud, al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam refused permission for non-Muslims to help whereas in the battle of Badr I'm pretty sure there were some non-Muslims who were allowed to help out the Muslim army. I also find it interesting that some Jews actually did want to help out the Muslim army, I wonder if this was organised by regular people or one of the leaders.

Interesting, Zayd ibn Ḥārithah was sent back from the Battle of Uḥud. Was it because he was injured/ill? Or was he too young? I didn't think he was that young... didn't he participate in Badr? Wait a second... Zayd ibn Ḥārithah **al-Anṣārī**... I did not know there was an Anṣārī by the same name. Okay, it wasn't easy to find him online, but I did find him on one site which did mention him as someone who was sent back on the day of Uḥud; he definitely is not a well-known ṣaḥābī tho.

I find this incident just soooo beautiful. al-Nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam *could* have just said to Samurah to go back but due to his young age it would have likely had a detrimental effect on him so al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam out of his mercy gave him a fair go to prove he could hold his position and thus he was allowed to join the army. This is just... so much wisdom. Also, al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam recognised the skills of Rāfi' ibn Khadīj
