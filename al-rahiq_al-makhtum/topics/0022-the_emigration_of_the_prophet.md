**Title:** The Emigration of the Prophet ﷺ

**Pages:** 203 -> 218

Okay, so out of these eleven men Jubayr raḍiallāhu 'anh and Abū al-Bukhtari are not present; perhaps they weren't totally on-board and makes the question ring in my mind: 'Did any of the pagans try warning al-nabī ﷺ?'. Perhaps they were too scared to do anything.

Maaaaaaaan. It says here that as he left his house he was reciting Qur-ān, subḥānallāh. al-nabī ﷺ was probably not scared due to Allāh likely having promised him protection but honestly when I'm walking alone and am a bit afraid for whatever reason I often just recite Qur-ān to calm myself down.

With the incident of the scorpion in the cave. I heard that Abū Bakr raḍiallāhu 'anh did his absolute best to not move (something which is almost impossible) so that he wouldn't wake up al-nabī ﷺ. I did not hear the part that his tears fell on the face of the prophet ﷺ and that al-nabī ﷺ then applied his saliva to the wound.

I heard that the shepherd, would also come with his sheep to hide the tracks of 'Abd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr raḍiallāhu 'anh.

I wonder how old 'Ali raḍiallāhu 'anh was at this time, they beat him whilst there was no one there to protect him... I mean is it really surprising if they beat up a kid if they even beat up a young girl/woman?? May Allāh recompense them all with what they deserve.

> They decided to block all routes leading out of Makkah and imposed heavy armed guard over all potential exits.

Did they know that they hadn't actually properly left Makkah yet? I heard they hired hunters and one especially skillful one; either Surāqah ibn Mālik or someone else and they were led to the cave of thawr however they did not see al-nabī ﷺ and his companion raḍiallāhu 'anh. Oh wow, I do that a lot; I got ahead of myself, the book mentions that literally in the next sentence.

Subḥānallāh, three days living in a cave... surely it would have been dark and uncomfortable. I wonder if they ever risked getting out temporarily to get some fresh air and stretch.

Oooh, very interesting... one of the ways they would cool down the milk was with water. It says the middle part of the milk container, I wonder if there was like a little section there for the water to go into and not mix with the milk but still cool the milk.

That's quite interesting, out of all of them the shepherd was the one who wrote the statement. Isn't it strange for a slave to be literate? Or was he not a slave but rather just a worker?
