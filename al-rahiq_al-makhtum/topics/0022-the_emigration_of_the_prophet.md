**Title:** The Emigration of the Prophet ﷺ

**Pages:** 203 -> 218

Okay, so out of these eleven men Jubayr raḍiallāhu 'anh and Abū al-Bukhtari are not present; perhaps they weren't totally on-board and makes the question ring in my mind: 'Did any of the pagans try warning al-nabī ﷺ?'. Perhaps they were too scared to do anything.

Maaaaaaaan. It says here that as he left his house he was reciting Qur-ān, subḥānallāh. al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam was probably not scared due to Allāh likely having promised him protection but honestly when I'm walking alone and am a bit afraid for whatever reason I often just recite Qur-ān to calm myself down.

With the incident of the scorpion in the cave. I heard that Abū Bakr raḍiallāhu 'anh did his absolute best to not move (something which is almost impossible) so that he wouldn't wake up al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam. I did not hear the part that his tears fell on the face of the prophet ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam and that al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam then applied his saliva to the wound.

I heard that the shepherd, would also come with his sheep to hide the tracks of 'Abd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr raḍiallāhu 'anh.

I wonder how old 'Ali raḍiallāhu 'anh was at this time, they beat him whilst there was no one there to protect him... I mean is it really surprising if they beat up a kid if they even beat up a young girl/woman?? May Allāh recompense them all with what they deserve.

> They decided to block all routes leading out of Makkah and imposed heavy armed guard over all potential exits.

Did they know that they hadn't actually properly left Makkah yet? I heard they hired hunters and one especially skillful one; either Surāqah ibn Mālik or someone else and they were led to the cave of thawr however they did not see al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam and his companion raḍiallāhu 'anh. Oh wow, I do that a lot; I got ahead of myself, the book mentions that literally in the next sentence.

Subḥānallāh, three days living in a cave... surely it would have been dark and uncomfortable. I wonder if they ever risked getting out temporarily to get some fresh air and stretch.

Oooh, very interesting... one of the ways they would cool down the milk was with water. It says the middle part of the milk container, I wonder if there was like a little section there for the water to go into and not mix with the milk but still cool the milk.

That's quite interesting, out of all of them the shepherd was the one who wrote the statement. Isn't it strange for a slave to be literate? Or was he not a slave but rather just a worker?

I find it quite interesting that the Muslims had already left with a caravan (likely for trade) before al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam even reached Madīnah or perhaps they left from Makkah which I still quite find interesting because surely the Quraysh would have tried to stop them.

> So they and their animals came out to pay him the respects due to Prophethood.

I wonder if the animals came out due to the people bringing them out or if it was a miracle and the animals did it of their own free will.

> God came from Teman and the Holy One from mount Faran.
> - Book of Habakkuk

I gotta look into that!

It's quite interesting that he prayed jum'uah in a valley (likely out in the open) as opposed to at masjid qubā- which had left on that very day. Oh this incident is mentioned in Bukhārī, let me find it. Alright, I was unable to find it perhaps I can find it later. (Bukhārī 1/555 & 1/560)

Subḥānallāh, a possible wisdom that just came to my mind with the choosing of the house in which al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam would stay in by his camel: if al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam chose himself either from his own will or through Allāh's command then a lot of people would have become jealous and possibly even fights could be caused however Allāh selecting the house through al-nabī's ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam camel prevented those hard feelings and Allāh knows best.

It mentions Fāṭimah, Umm Kulthūm and Zaynab raḍiallāhu 'anhunn but what about Ruqayyah raḍiallāhu 'anhā? I assume she was married to 'Uthmān ibn 'Affān raḍiallāhu 'anh by this time and they may have still been in Ḥabashah and Allāh knows best.

Seeing Usāmah ibn Zayd raḍiallāhu 'anh being mentioned confused me because I knew that he was born from Umm Ayman raḍiallāhu 'anhā however I thought that Zayd ibn Ḥārithah raḍiallāhu 'anh only married Umm Ayman *after* divorcing Zaynab bint Jaḥsh raḍiallāhu 'anhā however after researching it seems he actually married Umm Ayman first and hence it made sense for Usāmah ibn Zayd raḍiallāhu 'anh to already be born. During that research, I also found that on the wikipedia page that he raḍiallāhu 'anh was also married to a daughter of Abū Lahab but was divorced likely at the same time and for the same reason.
