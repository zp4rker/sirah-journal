**Title:** The Emigration of the Prophet ﷺ

**Pages:** 203 -> 218

Okay, so out of these eleven men Jubayr raḍiallāhu 'anh and Abū al-Bukhtari are not present; perhaps they weren't totally on-board and makes the question ring in my mind: 'Did any of the pagans try warning al-nabī ﷺ?'. Perhaps they were too scared to do anything.

Maaaaaaaan. It says here that as he left his house he was reciting Qur-ān, subḥānallāh. al-nabī ﷺ was probably not scared due to Allāh likely having promised him protection but honestly when I'm walking alone and am a bit afraid for whatever reason I often just recite Qur-ān to calm myself down.
