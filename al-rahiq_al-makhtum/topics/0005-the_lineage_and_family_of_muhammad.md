**Title:** The Lineage and Family of Muhammad ﷺ

**Pages:** 63 -> 70

Just for ease of memorisation and reading for now and later, I'm going to transliterate the Arabic lineage of al-nabī ﷺ

*Part 1:* Muḥammad ibn 'Abd Allāh ibn 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib (Shaybah) ibn Hāshim ('Amr) ibn 'Abd Manāf (al-Mughīrah) ibn Quṣay (Zayd) ibn Kilāb ibn Murrah ibn Ka'b ibn Luay ibn Ghālib ibn Fihr (Quraysh) ibn Mālik ibn al-Naḍr (Qays) ibn Kinānah ibn Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah ('Āmir) ibn Ilyās ibn Muḍar ibn Nizār ibn Ma'ad ibn 'Adnān.

*Part 2:* 'Adnān ibn Add ibn Humaysī' ibn Salāmān ibn 'Aws ibn Būz ibn Qamwāl ibn Ubay ibn 'Awwām ibn Nāshid ibn Ḥazā ibn Bildās ibn Yadlāf ibn Ṭābikh ibn Jāḥim ibn Nāḥish ibn Mākhī ibn 'Ayḍ ibn 'Abqar ibn 'Ubayd ibn al-Da'ābin ibn Ḥamdān ibn Sanbir ibn Yathrabī ibn Yaḥzin ibn Yalḥan ibn Ar'awī ibn 'Ayḍ ibn Dīshān ibn 'Aiṣar ibn Afnād ibn Ayhām ibn Muqṣar ibn Nāḥith ibn Zāriḥ ibn Samī ibn Mazzī ibn 'Awḍah ibn 'Arām ibn Qīdār ibn Ismā'īl ibn Ibrāhīm ('alayhimā al-salām)

*Part 3:* Ibrāhīm ibn Tāriḥ (Āzar) ibn Nāḥūr ibn Sārū' (or Sārūgh) ibn Rā'ū ibn Fālikh ibn Ābir ibn Shālikh ibn Arfakhshad ibn Sām ibn Nūh ('alayhi al-salām) ibn Lāmik ibn Mutwashlakh ibn Akhnūkh (said to be Idrīs 'alayhi al-salām) ibn Yarid Mahlaīl ibn Qaynān ibn Ānūshah ibn Shīth ibn Ādam ('alayhimā al-salām)

Ahh, it was Hāshim who started the bi-yearly Quraysh trade caravans; for some reason I thought it was Quṣay but I guess he can't have all the glory lol. Hmm, Hāshim had 9 children yet the only one we hear of is 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib; I wonder if the descendants of the others survived or not.

> Al-Muttalib saked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused. He managed to convice her saying: "Your son is going to Makkah to restore his father's authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred House."

According to this book, the transportation of 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib was a peaceful and mutual arrangement however I've actually heard otherwise: I've heard that al-Muṭṭalib actually had to kidnap 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib in order to bring him to Makkah. I guess I'll probably found more about this when I get into the other works.

> 'Abdul-Muttalib received the men and invited them to go to his house but Abu Sa'd said: "Not before I meet Nawfal." He found Nawfal sitting with some old men of Quraish in the shade of Al-Ka'bah. Abu Sa'd drew his sword and said: "I swear by Allâh that if you don't restore to my nephew what you have taken, I will kill you with this sword."

This is quite interesting... wouldn't that have been breaking the ḥaram, I thought killing was not allowed in the ḥaram **even** for the pre-Islamic Arabs. I guess they just paid that little heed to their religion even thought it was false anyways.

> ...and led a great army - **of sixty thousand warriors**...

Far out, that is a **HUGE** amount for that time.

> Abrahah himself had an infection that required his fingertips to be cut off. When he reached San'a', he was in a miserable state and died soon after.

Interesting... I thought that he died in the incident of the stones but he actually managed to survive it and make it back home before dying. Perhaps that was more humiliating for him than dying on the battle field, and Allāh knows best.

Very interestingly, this book does not seem to mention the incident of 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib having that famous conversation with Abrahah; was kind of hoping it would but in shā allāh I'll find it in another work.
