**Title:** Location and Nature of Arab Tribes

**Pages:** 23 -> 31

Not only is it vital context to the life of al-nabī ﷺ, there are so many wisdoms behind
Allāh's decision to send al-rasūl ﷺ to the Arabs such as the strategic (in multiple
aspects) geographical location of the Arabian Peninsula.

> Linguistically, the word "Arab" means deserts and barren land without water and vegetation. Ever since the dawn of history, this term has been used for the Arabian Peninsula and its people.

I find this quote quite interesting, it seems to give the impression that the Arabs were named by outsiders/non-Arabs however I've heard other meanings based off of the Arabic lexicon which have a sense of self-superiority with for example the comparison between *'arab* and *'ajam*. There are actually multiple different meanings which can be derived from the word *'arab* all of which fitted/suited the Arabs and gave a complete picture of the kind of people they were. If Allāh wills, I shall go back and listen to where I heard this and add further detail.

The information I was referring to is from [Episode 3 of Abdul Nasir Jangda's Seerah podcast on Qalam Institute](http://www.qalaminstitute.org/2011/09/seerah-life-of-the-prophet-pre-islamic-society-pt-1/) from `2:52` onwards.

To summarise: There are a variety of opinions. One of the most basic understandings of this word from its root is it refers to something that "runs" or something that "flows"; one of the uses of the word is for clear speech or clarity in speech. The word for non-Arab is 'ajam which actually means when they speak, they "babble" or speak gibberish. Another use of the word (derived) is for happiness as the example in the Qur-ān: *'urubun*. It was also used to describe something which is overflowing and also if something were to become chaotic for example if someone had an upset stomach. "When the river flows, that water: while it's flowing and it's beautiful but at the same time, it's not organised—it's very chaotic. It's a very beautiful controlled chaos."

> Another Yemeni tribe–Jurhum the Second–came and lived in Makkah upon Hagar's permission...

I decided to ask around for further information on what "Jurhum the Second" meant and was told that it is used to differentiate from Jurhum at the time of 'Ād and the ancient Arabs. Some historians say that Jurhum the Second were a revival of the remnants of Jurhum the First—the tribe of Jurhum at the time of the ancient Arabs.
