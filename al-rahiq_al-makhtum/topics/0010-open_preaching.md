The beginning of the public da'wah, I still wonder what the emotions were like at the very beginning  of this stage.

Subḥānallāh, right from the beginning- the very first audience-Abū Lahab takes a jab at al-nabī ﷺ so *if* there was any high hopes due to the success of the private da'wah stage, then it would have surely been crushed now. That being said, an audience did accept his invitation for another meeting which is interesting and leads me onto a thought which I'll mention shortly.

We see the real contrast between Abū Lahab and Abū Ṭālib right from the beginning, Abū Ṭālib is encouraging al-nabī ﷺ to continue his journey and vowing to protect him ﷺ. However it is quite interesting that Abū Ṭālib right from the beginning also says that he will not "quit the religion of 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib." I've heard that some people consider 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib to be of the ḥunafā- however al-nabī ﷺ said that he will go to jahannam and we also see here that Abū Ṭālib wants to follow the religion of 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib and Abū Ṭālib was a pagan so to me this seems like proof that 'Abd al-Muṭṭalib was also an idolater and thus it makes sense that he'll enter jahannam.

> "I swear by Allâh that this is a bad thing. You must stop him before the others do."

I find this quote of Abū Lahab quite interesting, I wonder if he said that because he would find it displeasing/disgraceful for someone from another tribe to be the one to oppose Muḥammad ﷺ.

> The Verses were immediately revealed on that occasion:

Subḥānallāh, I did not realise that these āyāt were revealed so early. It's quite cool how Allāh used a word from the same root as the word Abū Lahab used when insulting al-nabī ﷺ.

Something very interesting is that back at that time, the Quraysh decided to say that al-nabī ﷺ was a magician and a powerful one; what I find interesting about this is that all the attacks on al-nabī ﷺ have nothing to do with that at all. It just goes on to be a proof of the truthfulness and sincerity of al-nabī ﷺ and the reality that he is indeed the messenger of Allāh.
