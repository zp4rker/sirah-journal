> In Yemen, the people of Sheba were one of the oldest known nations of the pure Arabs.

The book makes mention of "Sheba" as one of the names in the past for the kingdom of Yemen which is also mentioned in the story of the Queen from Sheba and Sulaymān 'alayhi salām. I find it quite interesting how an Israelite king in Palestine interacted with an Arab Queen all the way in Yemen from amongst the Arabs whom according to a majority of scholars (from my knowledge) are *not* from the progeny of Ismā'īl 'alayhi salām but rather from the "pure Arabs" or the progeny of Qaḥṭān. I wonder if Banī Isrā'īl ever had any major incidents with the descendants of Ismā'īl 'alayhi salām, it would be interesting due to them both descending from Ibrāhīm 'alayhi salām.

Subḥānallāh! The amount of conflicts and different governments that governed Yemen in history is truly astonishing, especially from being supported by the Roman Christians (Abyssinians) to their independence (Qaḥṭānī) to the Abyssinians again then again back to the Qaḥṭānīs this time with the support of the Persians then that king was assassinated and the Persians installed a Persian king as a replacement. Then many years later, they accepted Islām. Absolutely astonishing! So much history in just a single area in the world.

I actually did not realise the Persians got this much involved with the Arabs, I thought it was just a little bit of the Byzantines getting involved with some of the northern Arab tribes; however, it does explain the historic first ever victory of the Arabs over the Persians. So both the Byzantines and the Sassanids appointed Arab kings in certain strategic areas i.e at the borders of their Nations.

Interestingly, the authority of Makkah didn't initially go to the tribe of Jurhum but rather Ismā'īl held the authority then after his passing his two sons Nābit then Qīdār (or in the reverse order) **then** their mother's father Muḍāḍ ibn 'Amr al-Jurhumī took over authority of Makkah and it doesn't seem to mention how he took over from Ismā'īl 'alayhi salām's sons since it does not appear that it was after their death.

The 'Adnānīs ruled for around 2000 years then only lost rulership for about 300 years, Allāh knows best but if they had not lost rulership they wouldn't have spread out throughout Arabia so perhaps there was a wisdom for them losing rulership for a short period of time. Also, maaaan Quṣay seems like he would have been a really powerful and influential man.

> Due the the fact that Qusai's deeds were regarded as unquestionable and his orders inviolable, his death gave no rise to conflicts among his sons...

Like subḥānallāh, not only was he powerful and influential but his people must have loved and/or respected him a high regard because *even* after his death they didn't try to undo what he had put in place despite a clear bias towards favouring a specific son.
