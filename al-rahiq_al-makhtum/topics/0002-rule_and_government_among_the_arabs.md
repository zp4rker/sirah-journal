> In Yemen, the people of Sheba were one of the oldest known nations of the pure Arabs.

The book makes mention of "Sheba" as one of the names in the past for the kingdom of Yemen which is also mentioned in the story of the Queen from Sheba and Sulaymān 'alayhi salām. I find it quite interesting how an Israelite king in Palestine interacted with an Arab Queen all the way in Yemen from amongst the Arabs whom according to a majority of scholars (from my knowledge) are *not* from the progeny of Ismā'īl 'alayhi salām but rather from the "pure Arabs" or the progeny of Qaḥṭān. I wonder if Banī Isrā'īl ever had any major incidents with the descendants of Ismā'īl 'alayhi salām, it would be interesting due to them both descending from Ibrāhīm 'alayhi salām.
