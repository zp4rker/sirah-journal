Subḥānallāh, that's HEAPS.

Oh wow, Jubayr ibn Muṭ'im participated in *that* meeting. Isn't he the son of Muṭ'im ibn 'Adī who became a ṣaḥābī. Yep, indeed he was.

Again, another incident of jinn getting directly involved with opposing the da'wah and this time it's Iblīs himself la'natullāhi 'alayh.

I wonder if Muṭ'im ibn 'Adī had passed away by this time since his son went to the meeting but not him.

It says that they **unanimously** agreed to the idea of killing al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam wal'iyādhu billāh, which I find quite interesting because at least a few of the attendants were somewhat sympathetic towards the Muslims such as Abū al-Bukhtarī whom helped out the Muslims during the boycott and also Jubayr ibn Muṭ'im whom I'm not certain was sympathetic towards the Muslims but I assume he was due to who his father was. I wonder if there's any stories or incidents where Jubayr ibn Muṭ'im raḍiallāhu 'anh talks about that meeting.
