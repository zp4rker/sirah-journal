> The Jews of Bani 'Awf

I wonder if Banū 'Awf was the parent tribe of the Jewish tribes in Madīnah.

I wonder if there were any instances where the Muslims went to help out the Jews as per the clauses of the treaty, there are no incidents which come to my mind however.

Oh wow, I don't know how I didn't realise this till now but one of the clauses of the treaty was to boycott the Quraysh commercially and not offer them any support.
