Subḥānallāh! I never thought about that, there's a reason why the muslims faced **so** much opposition both from local Makkans as well as other than them.

Subḥānallāh, the *very* first day...

I wonder who gave da'wah to Bilāl raḍiallāhu 'anh and how, considering he was a slave and a lot of if not most of the early converts were Makkans.

Subḥānallāh, never thought about the wisdom of the Makkan sūrāt (primarily juz- 'amma) having short āyāt and/or a lot of stops during the āyāt. It forces both the reciter and more importantly (at that time) the listener/audience to ponder deeply over what's being said.

Regarding the topic of the obligation of ṣalawāt prior to the night journey, I've heard that qiyām al-layl was either obligatory or extremely highly recommended.

It's quite interesting that Abū Ṭālib approved and encouraged the practice of ṣalāh even though it would have seemed like an innovation for him.

I wonder what the emotions of al-nabī ﷺ and the muslims were when the āyāt ordering for the da'wah to become public were like. Were they excited or scared? The three years of private da'wah seemed to have been a very successful and happy stage so perhaps they were excited to go public after being on a high but Allāh knows best.
