**Title:** The Makkan Period

**Pages:** 84

---

People often don't realise that the Makkan period was actually longer than the Madinan period which is of course because of the great amount of narrations of incidents during the Madinan stage as opposed to the Makkan stage.

Now looking at how the different stages of the Makkan period is split up:

1. The Secret Da'wah
- Lasted for three years
- Due to the private nature, I assume it's the least narrated about but I would assume it was a fairly peaceful and possibly even exciting stage due to (again by assumption) them not being persecuted and also due to it being in the veeery early stages of the nubuwwah

2. The Public Da'wah
- Lasted for the remaining 7 years of the Makkan period
- Would be the most documented part of the Makkan period due to the public nature. Probably one of, if not the hardest periods of the da'wah due to the amount of persecution that went on and due to the lack of power in the hands of the muslims

3. External Da'wah
- Towards the very end of the Makkan period and then through into the Madinan period
- Just goes to show how badly the muslims were persecuted at the time that *even* the prophet ï·º had to look outside of Makkah
