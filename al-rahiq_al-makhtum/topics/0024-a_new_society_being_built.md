I heard a story that Muḥammad ﷺ was initially offered and lived in the lower floor of Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī's house but after some time they swapped as in Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī's family moved to the lower floor and Muḥammad ﷺ and his companions (I believe it was Abū Bakr and Bilāl raḍiallāhu 'anhumā) due to the fact that he and his family raḍiallāhu 'anhum did not feel right being above al-nabī ﷺ. I'm not too sure on the authenticity nor the source of this story. Allāhu a'lam.

Did the building of the mosque start the next day or was there a short interlude to allow the muhājirīn including al-nabī ﷺ to recover from the journey?

I wonder what happened to the dug up graves, were there no bodies in there and therefore no need to do anything or did they have to re-bury them elsewhere? I also wonder if the pagans alive at the time opposed the digging up of those graves or not.

100 yards by 100 yards is about 90 metres by 90 metres which is actually quite decent in size which means it should have been able to hold several hundred to around one thousand people in it at once.

Ah, so the other ṣahābī who had the dream about the adhān was 'Abd Allāh ibn Zayd raḍiallāhu 'anh the other of course being 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb raḍiallāhu 'anh. I do wonder who this 'Abd Allāh ibn Zayd is, I have not heard his name before nor know anything about him except this incident. Hmm, looks like there isn't much known about him besides this incident however after some research it seems his father was Zayd ibn Tha'labah which does ring a bell but I'm not 100% sure where from.

I did not realise the muākhāh only occurred with 90 men, I always thought it was a lot more than that but I guess not all the muhājirīn needed support and/or there weren't many muhājirīn at this point.

I have not yet completed this chapter, in shā allāh I'll complete it later.
