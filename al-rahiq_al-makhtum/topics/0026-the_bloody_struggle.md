The pagans of Quraysh held ties with 'Abd Allāh ibn Ubay ibn Salūl but what I wonder is who initiated since both parties had benefit from it.

Subḥānallāh, I don't know how I never heard of this incident. The pagans of Madīnah, led by 'Abd Allāh ibn Ubay were prepared to fight (likely with the goal of killing) al-nabī ﷺ. I don't quite understand what al-nabī ﷺ said to them though, did he mean that those pagans were only doing it because they were scared the Quraysh would do something to them?

Subḥānallāh!!! What an amazing ḥadīth and what a beautiful blessing for Sa'd ibn Abī Waqqās raḍiallāhu 'anh.
