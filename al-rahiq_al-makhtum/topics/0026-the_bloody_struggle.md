The pagans of Quraysh held ties with 'Abd Allāh ibn Ubay ibn Salūl but what I wonder is who initiated since both parties had benefit from it.

Subḥānallāh, I don't know how I never heard of this incident. The pagans of Madīnah, led by 'Abd Allāh ibn Ubay were prepared to fight (likely with the goal of killing) al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam. I don't quite understand what al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam said to them though, did he mean that those pagans were only doing it because they were scared the Quraysh would do something to them?

Subḥānallāh!!! What an amazing ḥadīth and what a beautiful blessing for Sa'd ibn Abī Waqqās raḍiallāhu 'anh.

Very interesting... 30 men against 300? Sure, the 30 were prepared to fight whereas the others were prepared for a trade journey but still... that's 10 men for each man. It says they were aligned for fighting too, subḥānallāh the courage those ṣaḥāba must have had...

Interesting, in the "Rabigh Mission" there were 60 horsemen but in the battle of Badr there were only two? What happened to the rest of the horses? Also is this the incident in which Sa'd ibn Abī Waqqās raḍiallāhu 'anh shot the first arrow for the Muslims? It doesn't seem to mention Sa'd however I'm 90% sure he holds that title.

Subḥānallāh, quite an honour for al-Miqdād raḍiallāhu 'anh: just 1 month after joining the Muslims, he ends up becoming a flag bearer which I've heard is a great position.

100 men with 2500 camels, how is that even possible? They must have been **really** good at handling camels back then like wow... 25 camels per man...

I wonder if Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihrī is a descendant of Fihr and if so, why is he not called al-Qurashī?

I find it quite interesting that al-nabī ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam is appointing someone different each time he goes to do something out of Madīnah and all of them are of a very high level.

Interesting, Banū Dumrah is mentioned both i the Invasion of al-Abwa' and in the Invasion of Dhil 'Ushayrah and in both incidents he contracted a treaty though the former mentions a specific man from that tribe whereas the latter does not.
