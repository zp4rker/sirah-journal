> He brought with him an idol (Hubal) which he placed in the middle of Al-Ka'bah and summoned people to worship it.

I wonder if when this incident took place, if any people opposed or at least questioned it because surely it would have been something new to the majority of the people and from what I know of the Arabs pre-Islām is that they are not exactly welcome to new things in the way they do things as they prefer to "follow their forefathers." Even if no one within his tribe opposed/questioned it, surely at least someone from another tribe did as the book mentions:

> Readily enough, idolatry spread all over Makkah and **thence to Hijaz**...

In this paragraph:

> An idol called Manat was worshipped...

The book mentions some idols spread throughout Arabia, however I'm curious how *these* idols came about because 'Amr ibn Luḥay brought Hubal aaaall the way from al-Shām and didn't just make his own idol. Who had the audacity to make the first idol? Assuming of course that they were not aware of this practice. Perhaps these idols were also idols of old that people found as 'Amr ibn Luḥay did with the idols of the people of Nūh 'alayhi al-salām.

Speaking of the idols of Nūh's 'alayhi al-salām people, it is extremely interesting that they were buried in Jeddah; they were most likely buried as a result of the flood so is it possible that Nūh 'alayhi al-salām dwelled in Arabia? If so, then it kind of supports the opinion that Arabs existed pre-Sām and some were on Nūh's 'alayhi al-salām ark.

> ...and were deemed as good innovations rather than deviations from Abraham's religion.

Subḥānallāh!!! This makes me think of bid'ah and how certain groups proclaim their innovations claiming it to be good/truth when in fact they are deviations.

> 1. Self-devotion to the idols, seeking refuge with them, uttering oaths in their names, calling for their help in hardship, and supplication to them for fulfillment of wishes, believing that the idols could intercede before Allâh for the fulfillment of people's wishes.

Replace idol with saint and you get ṣūfiyyah, I don't know if I'm over-exaggerating there but that quote **definitely** makes me think of sufism. Also, it makes me think of shī'ah and links to my theory that ṣūfiyyah borrows a lot of things from the shī'ah.

> 2. Performing pilgrimage to the idols, circulating around them, humiliating themselves and even prostrating before them.

Again, same thing; makes me thing Sufi and Shī'ah.

> ...a female camel that gave birth to ten successive females, but no males.

I don't know if it's true or not, but I feel as though these weird animal traditions they had were invented due to monetary reasons; a she-camel was worth a lot! I also wonder if 'Amr ibn Luḥay practiced this before he discovered idols and if not, why did he only start after introducing idolatry?

> ...were assigned only for use or consumption by males.

Maaan, women really got the short end of the stick in pre-Islāmic Arabian society.

> They would say, "We were delivered rain because of the position of this star."

I believe the ḥadīth mentioned here is this one: https://sunnah.com/bukhari/64/191

> ...at the hand of the King Bukhtanassar.

I swear I've seen "Bukhtanassar" before... Yep! Bukhtanassar invaded Makkah twice it seems, when the tribe of Jurhum would have been in authority over Makkah. This is very very interesting, who was or who were Bukhtanassar and why did they/he cause so much havoc? Perhaps the *Mongolians* of that time?

This appears to be the King Bukhtanassar that kicked the Jews out of Palestine. There appears to be about 4 men by that name or title. Bukhtanassar II, III and IV all seem to have one thing in common: they rebelled; perhaps Bukhtanassar was a title then and not actually a name. The Bukhtanassar that invaded Makkah twice was most likely the same Bukhtanassar that caused the Jewish diaspora. Oooh interesting, he also seiged al-Quds (Jerusalem) twice similar to Makkah according to the bible. Also according to the bible, he was the "destroyer of nations." He also assaulted Egpyt (again according to the bible), so perhaps his kingdom really were like the Mongolians of that time.
