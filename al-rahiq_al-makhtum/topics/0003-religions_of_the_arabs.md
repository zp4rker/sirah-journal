> He brought with him an idol (Hubal) which he placed in the middle of Al-Ka'bah and summoned people to worship it.

I wonder if when this incident took place, if any people opposed or at least questioned it because surely it would have been something new to the majority of the people and from what I know of the Arabs pre-Islām is that they are not exactly welcome to new things in the way they do things as they prefer to "follow their forefathers." Even if no one within his tribe opposed/questioned it, surely at least someone from another tribe did as the book mentions:

> Readily enough, idolatry spread all over Makkah and **thence to Hijaz**...

In this paragraph:

> An idol called Manat was worshipped...

The book mentions some idols spread throughout Arabia, however I'm curious how *these* idols came about because 'Amr ibn Luḥay brought Hubal aaaall the way from al-Shām and didn't just make his own idol. Who had the audacity to make the first idol? Assuming of course that they were not aware of this practice. Perhaps these idols were also idols of old that people found as 'Amr ibn Luḥay did with the idols of the people of Nūh 'alayhi al-salām.

Speaking of the idols of Nūh's 'alayhi al-salām people, it is extremely interesting that they were buried in Jeddah; they were most likely buried as a result of the flood so is it possible that Nūh 'alayhi al-salām dwelled in Arabia? If so, then it kind of supports the opinion that Arabs existed pre-Sām and some were on Nūh's 'alayhi al-salām ark.

> ...and were deemed as good innovations rather than deviations from Abraham's religion.

Subḥānallāh!!! This makes me think of bid'ah and how certain groups proclaim their innovations claiming it to be good/truth when in fact they are deviations.

> 1. Self-devotion to the idols, seeking refuge with them, uttering oaths in their names, calling for their help in hardship, and supplication to them for fulfillment of wishes, believing that the idols could intercede before Allâh for the fulfillment of people's wishes.

Replace idol with saint and you get ṣūfiyyah, I don't know if I'm over-exaggerating there but that quote **definitely** makes me think of sufism. Also, it makes me think of shī'ah and links to my theory that ṣūfiyyah borrows a lot of things from the shī'ah.

> 2. Performing pilgrimage to the idols, circulating around them, humiliating themselves and even prostrating before them.

Again, same thing; makes me thing Sufi and Shī'ah.
