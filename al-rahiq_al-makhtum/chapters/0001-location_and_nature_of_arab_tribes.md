**Pages:** 23 -> 31

Not only is it vital context to the life of al-nabī ﷺ, there are so many wisdoms behind
Allāh's decision to send al-rasūl ﷺ to the Arabs such as the strategic (in multiple
aspects) geographical location of the Arabian Peninsula.

> Linguistically, the word "Arab" means deserts and barren land without water and vegetation. Ever since the dawn of history, this term has been used for the Arabian Peninsula and its people.

I find this quote quite interesting, it seems to give the impression that the Arabs were named by outsiders/non-Arabs however I've heard other meanings based off of the Arabic lexicon which have a sense of self-superiority with for example the comparison between *'arab* and *'ajam*. There are actually multiple different meanings which can be derived from the word *'arab* all of which fitted/suited the Arabs and gave a complete picture of the kind of people they were. If Allāh wills, I shall go back and listen to where I heard this and add further detail.
