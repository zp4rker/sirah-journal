Bismillāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm

I'll be creating this glossary to help myself and other know the correct Arabic spelling (using my transliteration technique) of various names and words. The lists are in no specific order.

Just to clarify, this is *not* an index of names but rather just a glossary of names/words which in transliterated (again using my transliteration technique) form does not match how it is written in the book.
