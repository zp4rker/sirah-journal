# Transliteration Guide

Here is a guide on how I intend to transliterate Arabic to English throughout this journal and likely into future notes.

| Letters
| ---
`ب -> b`
`ت -> t`
`ث -> th`
`ج -> j`
`ح -> ḥ`
`خ -> kh`
`د -> d`
`ذ -> dh`
`ر -> r`
`ز -> z`
`س -> s`
`ش -> sh`
`ص -> ṣ`
`ض -> ḍ`
`ط -> ṭ`
`ظ -> ẓ`
`ع -> '` (always when it has a vowel and after a preceding vowel if sākinah)
`غ -> gh`
`ف -> f`
`ق -> q`
`ك -> k`
`ل -> l`
`م -> m`
`ن -> n`
`ه -> h`
`و -> w`
`ي -> y`
`ء -> -` (if preceded by a vowel or after vowel of previous letter if sākinah)

| Ḥarakāt
| ---
`fatḥah -> a`
`fatḥah elongated -> ā`
`ḍammah -> u`
`ḍammah elongated -> ū`
`kasrah -> i`
`kasrah elongated -> ī`


##### Other notes
- ال will always be written as `al-` regardless of if verbally the lām is not pronounced and the following letter is given a shaddah
- Letters with a sukūn may be followed by a `-` if combined with the following letter could depict a letter for example dāl (d) and hā (h) becoming dhāl (dh)
- With transliteration of multiple words, the trailing ḥarakah of each word may be dropped with the exception of some common phrases/words and possibly other exceptions (pronouns)
  - In the following example, the ḥarakah of the first word is kept and whereas for the second word it is dropped: `al-ḥamdu lillāh`
- Some words in common phrases may be merged into single words for example: `bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm`
  - Technically it should be: `bism allāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm` however due to the nature of the phrase, the first two words are combined
